# EcoHoods 

PROJECT BUILT DURING THE [IBM HACKATHON 2019!](https://www.ibmhackbe.com) :computer:


This was a competition aimed to sell an idea to [Telenet](https://www2.telenet.be/content/www-telenet-be/nl/business/producten-diensten/internet-of-things) and [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/be-en). Telenet were looking for an innovative idea that could fit into their Smart Home services. IBM were looking for our idea to be built into their IBM Cloud services such as Watson and Node Red. 

Our idea was EcoHoods! Ecohoods is a platform that allows users to see how much money they have saved from using eco smart devices (e.g. eco friendly lightbulbs, solar panels, humidity sensors). It also gives users a digital community to hold each other accountable. Users can also gain points and become an influencer!

This was a group project built by a team of 4 developers. The objective was to sell an idea and create a mock up web app built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. 
We used the Agile Methodology to complete the task efficiently and on time.

## User scenario:

"Samantha has some money to invest. She's also conscious about global warming. She asks her friend Jenny for some advice, who happens to also be a Telenet user. Jenny recommends her to use EcoHoods! She sends her an invite via email. Samantha directly connects into EcoHoods thanks to her Telenet digital ID. Samantha sees on her dashboard the money she has saved, her ecopoints, and her ranking. Thanks to Jenny, she's also part of a digital neighborhood called "Flower", who collectively save, gain points, and rankings. In order to gain points, she can connect her devices to her smart home. She can buy new smart devices on the preview page. She can see her rankings and compare herself to Jenny's page. She can also go into private mode. Watson is the EcoHoods bot, who will send her reminders if she needs motivation! She can also become an influencer by gaining points! "


Samantha is happy because she can save money  and the planet !
